    "As house prices continue to rise in New York City, the ripple effects on communities are profound. For example, the median home price in NYC reached approximately \\$754,000 as of September 2024, 29.5\\% increase from that of September 2017. While rapidly increasing property values may signal economic growth, they also contribute to housing instability and displacement, particularly among lower-income residents. At the same time, access to quality educational resources remains a crucial factor for many families in deciding where to live. In areas where public schools are highly rated and well-attended, home prices often exceed city averages, reflecting the economic value of educational resources placed on educational quality. This project aims to investigate the factors that contribute to rising house prices in NYC, their impact on eviction rates and the intersection between educational outcomes and housing markets. By understanding these relationships, we hope to inform policymakers and community stakeholders on how to address the challenges of access to quality education, housing affordability and stability in the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three questions that we seek to answer in an analysis of housing price, eviction rate, and educational datasets for NYC are:\n",
    "1. What impact does rising housing prices have on eviction rates in NYC? Are these strongly correlated?\n",
    "2. Does the change in eviction rate due to housing prices predict a change in primary/secondary education attendance? Specifically: do neighborhoods with higher eviction rates, potentially due to rising housing costs, see a decrease in school attendance?\n",
    "3. How do the relationships between housing prices, eviction rates, and education vary across different neighborhoods in NYC? Do the predictive relationships differ in locations with different socioeconomic characteristics?"
